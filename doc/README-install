How to install LavaRnd
======================

    for LavaRnd version 0.1.2

QUICK START:
-----------

    If you have not ready compiled LavaRnd, see the file:

	doc/README-compile

    To install LavaRnd with the default configuration:

	cd your_src_tree/LavaRnd-0.1.2

	# NOTE: cameradev is your camera device name, it is often
	#
	#		/dev/video0 or /dev/video
	#
	# NOTE: camtype is one of the supported camera types, the command:
	#
	#		LD_LIBRARY_PATH=lib/shared tool/camset list all
	#
	#	will print a list of supported camtypes
	#
	# Example:
	#
	#	make install LAVARND_VIDEODEV=/dev/video0 LAVARND_CAMTYPE=pwc730

	make install LAVARND_VIDEODEV=cameradev LAVARND_CAMTYPE=camtype

	# unplug your supported webcams

	# disable any previously loaded webcam modules
	tool/unload_modules

	# force modules to be configured correctly
	(cd daemon; make usb_setup)

	# now plug your supported webcam back in

	# start LavaRnd

	chkconfig LavaRnd on
	/etc/init.d/LavaRnd start

starting trickle:
----------------

    On systems that have /dev/random, one can slightly improve the quality
    of the that generator by using trickle:

	# start trickle (optional)

	chkconfig trickle on
	/etc/init.d/trickle start

    The trickle daemon will add LavaRnd random data to the /dev/random
    mixing pool.  In doing so it does not change /dev/random's vague
    notion of the amount of entropy available, but it does contribute
    high quality random noise to help frustrate /dev/random attacks.

    By chkconfig trickle on, it will preload /dev/random with quality
    random data and help avoid initial state replay attacks.

    NOTE: Use of trickle requires the LavaRnd Perl interface to be working.
    	  You may have to re-install LavaRnd to get this to work.  See
	  the doc/BUGS file for details.
