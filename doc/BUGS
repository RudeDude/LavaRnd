Known bugs with LavaRnd version 0.1.3 code:

* Perl modules do not load:
  2003-08-17

    On a few systems, the Perl modules (and tool/test_perllib) fail to load:

	#     Failed test (../perllib/LavaRnd/Exit/t/1.t at line 34)
	#     Tried to use 'LavaRnd::Exit'.
	#     Error:  Can't load '/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.0/i386-linux-thread-multi/auto/LavaRnd/Exit/Exit.so' for module LavaRnd::Exit: /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.0/i386-linux-thread-multi/auto/LavaRnd/Exit/Exit.so: undefined symbol: lavarnd_errno at /usr/lib/perl5/5.8.0/i386-linux-thread-multi/XSLoader.pm line 83.

	# Compilation failed in require at (eval 1) line 2.
	Can't locate auto/LavaRnd/Exit/lavarnd_err.al in @INC (@INC contains: /usr/lib/perl5/5.8.0/i386-linux-thread-multi /usr/lib/perl5/5.8.0 /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.0/i386-linux-thread-multi /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.0 /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl /usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.8.0/i386-linux-thread-multi /usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl/5.8.0 /usr/lib/perl5/vendor_perl .) at ../perllib/LavaRnd/Exit/t/1.t line 60

    We have not been able to reproduce this problem on other systems.
    On one system the problem went away when we re-installed LavaRnd.
    Perhaps doing a complete:

    	make clobber
	make all
	su	# become root
	make install
	exit	# become normal

    will fix this problem like it did for one of our systems that
    encountered this problem.

    NOTE: As of version 0.1.1, the 'make install' tool does a
          'cd perllib; make clobber; make all; make install'
	  after the other sub-directories have been installed.

    Strange!
