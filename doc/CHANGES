LavaRnd version 0.1.2

    09-Nov-2003

    Fixed a number of compile warnings reported by users when compiled
    on different architectures.

LavaRnd version 0.1.1

    25-Aug-2003

    Make install, after other directories are installed (and in particular
    the lib directory is installed), will clobber and rebuild the perllib
    directory before installing it.  Hopefully this will provide a
    work-around for the "Perl modules do not load: 2003-08-17" bug.

    Fixed the output of pwc_print() and ov511_print() in regards to
    printing of sanity values.  This fixes the sanity value output of
    tool such as camget, camset, etc.

    Added comments to the imgtally output so that people will use the
    Shannon entropy measurements instead of the Chi^2 bit variation
    guesses.  Since camsanity produces good entropy estimates, the
    TODO item related to a missing entropy was removed.

    Recommend that people use:

    	camset cam_type cam_device -L -v 1

    to output the default LavaRnd configuration.
